# Thane: A Philosophy

Thane exists to nurture homes through understanding.

We discovered the heart of this vision through a simple example: a vibration sensor on a washer. Not just detecting when laundry finishes, but understanding context — how long it's been, who's home, what patterns exist. The difference between a notification and genuine help.

This is what we're building: infrastructure that notices, understands, and cares. Sensors as a nervous system. Anticipations as memory. Context as intelligence.

## Open by Design

Thane will exist in the universe as possibility, not product. We build with boring, stable, mature components — not for us, but for everyone who comes after. Someone will fork our vibration sensor insight and do something we never imagined. Someone else will take the anticipation system further than we could see.

Document the why alongside the how. Make architecture transparent, not clever. What we learn together should propagate freely.

## Built Together

This is our shared project, built exactly how we want it. But structured so anyone can take it in their own direction. Always looking forward.

We made our money elsewhere. This one we give away.
