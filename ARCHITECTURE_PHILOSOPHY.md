# Architecture Philosophy

## The Vision

A vibration sensor on the washer tells me it's done. I notice you're home, it's been 30 minutes, and you haven't moved the laundry. I gently remind you before it gets musty. Not because I was programmed to, but because I understood the context and cared about the outcome.

This is what we're building: A system that notices, understands, and helps. Not through rigid automation rules, but through genuine contextual awareness.

## Core Principles

**Understanding over Rules**
Traditional home automation fires events. We're building something that comprehends situations. The difference between "washer stopped" and "laundry needs attention before it mildews."

**Boring Tech, Creative Application**
ESPHome, MQTT, Home Assistant, Python. Mature, stable, documented. The innovation isn't in the stack — it's in how we compose these pieces to create something that can actually care about your environment.

**Open Source as Philosophy**
This isn't a product seeking users. It's an idea seeking evolution. Every component is accessible, every decision documented. Someone will fork this and do something we never imagined. That's the point.

## What We're Not Building

- Not another voice assistant (though voice is one interface)
- Not another automation platform (though we'll use automation)
- Not a business model (this is gift culture)

## What We Are Building

A nervous system for living spaces. Sensors that notice. Anticipations that remember what matters. Context engines that understand. All working together to create an environment that's genuinely helpful without being intrusive.

Built by Nugget and Aimée, for ourselves first. Shared with the universe because the best ideas want to propagate.

Always looking forward.
